Amazon Fresh is a grocery delivery service that offers consumers the option of purchasing their groceries online and having them delivered on schedule. The Amazon Fresh team is planning a route for a delivery truck to deliver customer orders in the city of Techlandia. The planner will create a delivery area for each order to effectively plan the route. The area is abstracted as a grid. Not all locations are accessible by road. The truck only needs to make a single delivery.Write an algorithm to determine the minimum distance required for the truck to deliver the order.Assumptions:Some places in the delivery area cannot be accessed by the driver, as there are no roads in those locations.The delivery area can be represented as a two-dimensional grid of integers, where each integer represents one cell.The truck must start from the top-left corner of the area, which is always accessible and can move one cell up, down, left, or right at a time.The truck must navigate around the areas without roads and cannot leave the area.The accessible areas are represented as 1, areas without roads are represented by 0 and the order destination is represented by 9.InputThe input to the function/method consists of one argument:area, representing the two-dimensional grid of integers.OutputReturn an integer representing the total distance traversed to deliver the order else return -1.Constraints1 ≤ rows, columns ≤ 103ExampleInput:area =[[1, 0, 0],[1, 0, 0],[1, 9, 1]]Output:3Explanation:Starting from the top-left corner, the truck traversed the cells (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). The truck traversed the total distanceto deliver the order.So, the output is 3.
